# predictive-analytics-workshop
Jupyter notebook for a workshop on Predictive Analytics with Python held at [Picalike](https://www.picalike.com/) in Hamburg on February 5th 2020.

Updated for an online workshop for the working group on artificial intelligence of [D64](https://d-64.org/) in February 2021.

Uses the Human Resource dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set).
You need an account to download the `.csv` file and put it into the folder with the code.

## How To

1. Clone this project or download the `.ipynb` file into a new folder
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
   - Tip: On macOS use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
   - Optional: Create a virtual environment for Python dependencies using `venv`
1. Run `python3 -m pip install jupyterlab` to install `jupyterlab` using `pip` in a Terminal window
1. Run `python3 -m pip install numpy` to install `numpy`
1. Run `python3 -m pip install pandas` to install `pandas` ([documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html))
1. Run `python3 -m pip install matplotlib` to install `matplotlib`
1. Run `python3 -m pip install sklearn` to install `scikitlearn`
1. Run `jupyterlab notebook` to start the notebook
    - This automatically opens a new browser tab with the Jupyter file browser
1. Select the file `./Predictive-Analytics.ipynb`
   - This opens a new browser tab with the Jupyter notebook
   - Happy coding & analysis!
